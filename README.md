# 🚀 Docker Learning Project – MERN App Containerization

📌 About This Project

This repository documents my learning journey with Docker.
I explored the fundamentals of how Docker works, including images, containers, and Docker Compose, and successfully dockerized a basic MERN stack application.

Both the frontend and backend were containerized separately and made to communicate with each other using Docker Compose.

This project helped me understand real-world containerization workflows.
